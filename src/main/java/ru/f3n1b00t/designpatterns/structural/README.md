# 🚗 Car Design Patterns Project - Structural Design Patterns

Welcome to the Structural Design Patterns section of the Car Design Patterns Project! In this section, you'll explore various Structural Design Patterns implemented in Java, all aimed at organizing and composing objects to form larger structures while keeping the system flexible and efficient.

## 🌟 Overview

This section covers the following Structural Design Patterns:

1. [**Adapter**](src/main/java/ru/f3n1b00t/designpatterns/structural/adapter)
2. [**Bridge**](src/main/java/ru/f3n1b00t/designpatterns/structural/bridge)
3. [**Composite**](src/main/java/ru/f3n1b00t/designpatterns/structural/composite)
4. [**Decorator**](src/main/java/ru/f3n1b00t/designpatterns/structural/decorator)
5. [**Facade**](src/main/java/ru/f3n1b00t/designpatterns/structural/facade)
6. [**Proxy**](src/main/java/ru/f3n1b00t/designpatterns/structural/proxy)

## 🏗️ What Are Structural Design Patterns?

Structural Design Patterns are a category of design patterns that deal with the composition of objects to form larger, more complex structures. These patterns focus on organizing and simplifying the relationships between objects and classes, making it easier to create flexible and efficient systems.

Structural patterns are concerned with questions like:
- How can we build class hierarchies effectively?
- How can we create stable and reusable interfaces to abstract complex systems?
- How can we add new functionality to objects without modifying their code directly?

In this section of the project, you'll explore various Structural Design Patterns and see how they can be applied to compose and organize objects effectively, enhancing the overall design and maintainability of your software.

Each pattern comes with detailed code examples and explanations, making it easy for you to grasp the concepts and apply them to your own projects. Explore the patterns by clicking the links above to see how they are implemented in the context of a car simulation.
