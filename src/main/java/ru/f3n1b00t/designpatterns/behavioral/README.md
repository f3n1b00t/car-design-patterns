# 🚗 Car Design Patterns Project - Behavioral Patterns

Welcome to the Behavioral Patterns section of the Car Design Patterns Project! In this section, you'll discover various Behavioral Design Patterns implemented in Java, all aimed at simulating car-related operations and behaviors. These patterns demonstrate how design patterns can be applied to real-world scenarios, making software development more efficient and maintainable.

## 🧠 What Are Behavioral Design Patterns?

Behavioral Design Patterns are a category of design patterns that deal with the communication and interaction between objects in a software system. They focus on defining how different objects collaborate and distribute responsibilities, with the goal of making the system's behavior more organized, flexible, and maintainable.

Behavioral patterns are concerned with questions like:
- How can objects communicate effectively without being tightly coupled?
- How can we encapsulate complex behavioral logic and make it reusable?
- How can we enable objects to adapt their behavior dynamically at runtime?

In this section of the project, you'll explore various Behavioral Design Patterns and see how they can be applied in practical scenarios to improve the design and maintainability of your software.
